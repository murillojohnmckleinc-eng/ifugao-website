    <h1>The Ifugao Tribe</h1>
   <p>
The Ifugao are one of the indigenous cultural communities found in the Cordillera
Administrative Region in Northern Luzon, Philippines. They are widely known for
their strong cultural identity, traditional beliefs, and close relationship with
nature. The name “Ifugao” is believed to have originated from the word “Ipugo,”
which means “people of the earth.”
