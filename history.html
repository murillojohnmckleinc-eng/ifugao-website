    <h1>History of the Ifugao</h1>
   <p>
The history of the Ifugao people dates back thousands of years, long before foreign
colonizers arrived in the Philippines. They settled in the mountainous regions of
Ifugao province, where they developed unique survival skills to adapt to the steep
terrain and harsh environment. These early communities relied heavily on agriculture,
particularly rice farming, for their livelihood.
