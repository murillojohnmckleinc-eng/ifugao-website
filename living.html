    <h1>Way of Living</h1>
  <p>
The way of living of the Ifugao people is centered on simplicity, cooperation,
and sustainability. Most communities rely on farming, particularly rice cultivation,
as their primary source of food and livelihood. Daily activities are often shared
among family members, strengthening their sense of unity and cooperation.The Ifugao value community life, where helping one another is an important part of
their culture. Practices such as communal labor, sharing resources, and respecting
elders play a significant role in maintaining harmony within the community. These
values are taught from a young age and continue to guide their way of life.
