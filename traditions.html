    <h1>Ifugao Traditions</h1>
  The traditions of the Ifugao people are deeply rooted in their beliefs, rituals,
and respect for ancestral spirits. These traditions are closely connected to rice
farming, which plays a central role in their culture. Rituals are often performed
to ask for blessings, give thanks for a good harvest, or seek guidance from their
ancestors.One of the most important traditions of the Ifugao is the performance of rituals
led by community elders or priests known as “mumbaki.” These rituals involve
chants, offerings, and ceremonies that strengthen the connection between humans,
nature, and the spiritual world. Festivals and celebrations are also held to mark
important events in the agricultural cycle.
